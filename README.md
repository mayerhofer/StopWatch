# StopWatch
A StopWatch developed with WPF and C#.
The elapsed time - 'hours::minutes::seconds' - is displayed with three buttons:

Start: Starts the stopwatch.
Pause: Pauses the stopwatch.
Stop: Stops the stopwatch and resets the timer.

Whenever the time is paused or stopped the current value is kept in memory and displayed in a list for future reference.
